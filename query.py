# Part 2: Write queries

# 1. Get the brand with the **id** of 8.
db.session.query(Brand).filter(Brand.id == 8).one()


# 2. Get all models with the **name** Corvette and the **brand_name** Chevrolet.
db.session.query(Model).filter_by(name="Corvette", brand_name="Chevrolet").all()

# 3. Get all models that are older than 1960.
db.session.query(Model).filter(Model.year == 1960)

# 4. Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
db.session.query(Brand).filter(Model.year > 1920)

# 5. Get all models with names that begin with "Cor".
db.session.query(Model).filter(Model.name.like('%Cor%')).all()

# 6. Get all brands with that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.
db.session.query(Brand).filter((Brand.founded == 1903) & (Brand.discontinued.isnot("null")))

# 7. Get all brands with that are either discontinued or founded before 1950.
db.session.query(Brand).filter((Brand.founded < 1950) | (Brand.discontinued.isnot("null")))

# 8. Get any model whose brand_name is not Chevrolet.
db.session.query(Model).filter(Model.brand_name.isnot("Chevrolet"))

# Fill in the following functions. (See directions for more info.)

# Part 3: Discussion Questions (Include your answers as comments.)

# 1. What is the returned value and datatype of ``Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')``?

# 2. In your own words, what is an association table, and what *type* of relationship
# does an association table manage?
